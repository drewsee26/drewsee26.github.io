## Game Rules
* The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
* In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as they whish. Each result gets added to their ROUND score.
* BUT, if the player rolls a 1 on either die, all their ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
* The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
* The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
* The GLOBAL score can be adjusted before the start of the game if you want to play a shorter or longer game.
