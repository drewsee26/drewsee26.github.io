## Summary

Choose your music.  Unlimited, streaming, ad-free.  Mobile enabled.

## Explanation

I wanted to create a music player that would show three albums and music for each.  The music could be started and stopped from the song number button or from the player bar at the bottom.  Seek controls for the song and volume are also available.

## Technologies Used

Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS
