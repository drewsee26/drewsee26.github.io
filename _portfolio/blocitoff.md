## Summary

To-do lists are notorious for collecting junk - tasks that you want to remember but constantly reprioritize. To solve the problem of to-do list clutter, Blocitoff will manage your to-do lists by automatically deleting tasks that have not been completed after seven days.

If the task is not important enough to be completed within seven days, it does not belong on your to-do list.

## Technologies Used

AngularJS, Bootstrap, Firebase API, NodeJS
